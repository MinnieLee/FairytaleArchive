                <p>

                    There was once a miller who had a beautiful daughter, and when she was grown, he wanted to make sure
                    that she was provided for and well married. He thought: "If the right kind of suitor comes along and
                    asks for her hand, I shall give her to him."
                    Not much later a suitor turned up who seemed to be rich, and since the miller could find nothing
                    wrong with him, he promised him his daughter. But the girl didn't care for him as a girl should care
                    for her betrothed, and she didn't trust him. Whenever she looked at him or thought of him, her heart
                    filled with dread.
                    One day he said to her: “You're engaged to me, and yet you've never once visited me." The girl
                    replied: "I don't know where you live."
                    The bridegroom answered: “My house is out in the dark forest."
                    The girl made excuses and claimed that she couldn't find the way there. But the bridegroom said:
                    “Next Sunday you have to come to my place. I've already invited the guests, and I'll put ashes on
                    the path so that you can find your way through the woods." When Sunday came and the girl was
                    supposed to leave, she became dreadfully frightened without knowing why, and she filled both her
                    pockets with peas and lentils to mark the way. At the entrance to the woods she found the trail of
                    ashes and followed it, but at every step she threw some peas on the ground, first to the right and
                    then to the left. She walked almost the entire day until she got to the middle of the forest, where
                    it was the gloomiest. There she saw a house standing by itself, but she didn't like the look of it
                    because it seemed dark and spooky. She walked in. It was deadly silent, and no one was around.
                    Suddenly a voice cried out:
                    "Turn back, turn back, my pretty young bride,
                    In a house of murderers you've arrived.”
                    The girl looked up and saw that the voice was coming from a bird in a cage hanging on the wall. Once
                    again it cried out:
                    "Turn back, turn back, my pretty young bride,
                    In a house of murderers you've arrived.”
                    The beautiful bride went all over the house from one room to the next, but it was completely empty
                    and not a soul could be found in it. Finally she went down to the cellar, where she found a woman as
                    old as the hills, her head bobbing up and down. "Can you tell me if my betrothed lives here?” asked
                    the girl.
                    “Oh, you poor child!” said the old woman. “How did you get here? This is a den of murderers. You
                    think you're a bride about to be married, but the only wedding you'll celebrate is one with death.
                    Look over here! I had to heat up this big pot of water for them. When you get into their hands,
                    they'll show no mercy and chop you into pieces, cook you, and eat you, for they are cannibals.
                    You're lost unless I take pity on you and try to save you."
                    The old woman hid her behind a big barrel, where no one could see her. “Be still as a mouse," she
                    said. "Don't stir and don't move or it'll be the end of you. At night, when the robbers are
                    sleeping, we'll escape. I've been waiting for this moment for a long time."
                    No sooner had she spoken than the ungodly crew returned home, dragging another maiden in with them.
                    They were drunk and paid no attention to her screams and sobs. They gave her wine to drink, three
                    glasses full, one white, one red, one yellow, and soon her heart burst in two. They tore off her
                    fine clothes, put her on a table, chopped her beautiful body into pieces, and sprinkled them with
                    salt.
                    The poor girl was trembling and shaking from her hiding place behind the barrel, for she now
                    understood what the robbers had in store for her. One of them caught sight of a gold ring on the
                    little finger of the murdered girl, and when he couldn't pull it off right away, he took an ax and
                    chopped the finger off. The finger went flying through the air up over the barrel and landed right
                    in the girl's lap. The robber took a candle and wanted to go looking for it but couldn't find it.
                    Another of the robbers asked: "Have you looked over there behind that big barrel?" Just then the old
                    woman called out: “Come and eat! You can look again tomorrow. The finger isn't going to go running
                    off."
                    "The old woman's right," the robbers said, and they put an end to their search and sat down to eat.
                    The old woman put a few drops of a sleeping potion into their wine, and soon they retired to the
                    cellar where they were snoring away in their sleep.
                    When the bride heard them snoring, she came out from behind the barrel and made her way over the
                    sleeping bodies arranged in rows on the ground. She was terrified that she might wake one of them
                    up, but God guided her footsteps. The old woman went up the stairs with her, opened the door, and
                    they ran as fast as they could from the den of murderers. The wind had scattered the ashes, but the
                    peas and lentils had sprouted and showed the way in the moonlight. The two walked all night long. In
                    the morning they reached the mill, and the girl told her father about everything that had happened.
                    When the day of the wedding celebration arrived, the groom appeared, as did all the friends and
                    relatives invited by the miller. When they sat down for dinner, each person was asked to tell a
                    story. The bride sat quietly and didn't utter a word. Finally the bridegroom said to his bride:
                    "Don't you have anything to say, my love? You have to tell us something."
                    "Very well," she replied, "I will tell you about a dream I had. I was walking alone through the
                    woods and came across a house. Not a soul was living in it, but on the wall there was a cage, and in
                    it was a bird that cried out:
                    "Turn back, turn back, my pretty young bride,
                    In a house of murderers you've arrived.'
                    "Then it repeated those words. My dear, I must have been dreaming all this. Then I walked from room
                    to room and each was completely empty. Everything was so spooky. Finally I went down to the cellar,
                    and there I saw a woman as old as the hills, her head bobbing up and down. I asked her: 'Does my
                    betrothed live here?' She replied: 'Oh, you poor child, you have stumbled into a den of murderers.
                    Your betrothed lives here, but he is planning to chop you up and kill you, and then he'll cook you
                    and eat you up.' My dear, I must have been dreaming all this. The old woman hid me behind a big
                    barrel, and no sooner was I hidden than the robbers returned home, dragging a maiden with them. They
                    gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, yellow, and her heart burst in two. My dear, I
                    must have been dreaming all this. Then they tore off her fine clothes, chopped her beautiful body
                    into pieces, and sprinkled it with salt. My dear, I must have been dreaming all this. One of the
                    robbers caught sight of a gold ring on her finger and since it was hard to pull off, he took an ax
                    and chopped it off. The finger flew through the air up behind the big barrel and landed in my lap.
                    And here is the finger with the ring.”
                    With these words, she pulled it out and showed it to everyone there.
                    The robber, who had turned white as a ghost while she was telling the story, jumped up and tried to
                    escape, but the guests seized him and turned him over to the authorities. He and his band were
                    executed for their dreadful deeds.
