                    Who does not love a Cinderella story? Or for that matter a Cinderella team or a Cinderella ending?
                    Our quintessential story about a rise from rags to riches has also become a cultural meme for
                    capturing dramatic turnarounds, hard-won victories that are earned by a deserving underdog. The
                    tropes that accompany versions of the story-missing shoes or cruel stepsisters—have migrated into
                    many different narratives, flashing out at us as reminders of a fairy-tale drama that mingles
                    persecution at home and class differences with romance that takes the form of love at first sight.
                    The version of "Cinderella” best known in Anglo-American and European cultures comes from Charles
                    Perrault, who published his "Cendrillon” in 1697. Disney's 1950 feature-length animated Cinderella
                    opens to the image of a book with a voice-over that gives us the beginning of Perrault's tale about
                    a beleaguered heroine, an evil stepmother and her daughters, a fairy godmother, a pumpkin, glass
                    slippers, and a midnight spell. Since Disney, the story's staying power has derived from its
                    depiction of maternal cruelty and sibling rivalry as well as its staging of the power of radiant
                    beauty. Both Cinderella and the Prince are transformed, with one rising phoenix-like from the ashes
                    and the other determined to find his soul mate via a sole mate.
                    The double transformation that fuels the narrative energy of “Cinderella” leads to a happily ever
                    after in virtually every version of her story. But the heroine's stepsisters rarely fare well. Who
                    can forget the final scene of the Grimms' "Cinderella,” which graphically describes the fate of
                    those ill-tempered, disagreeable pretenders to the throne?
                    When the couple went to church, the elder sister was on the right, the younger on the left side: the
                    doves pecked one eye from each one. Later, when they left the church, the elder sister was on the
                    left, the younger on the right. The doves pecked the other eye from each one. (see here)

                    For their “wickedness and malice” (see here) the sisters are punished with blindness for the rest of
                    their lives. This ending, along with the details of the mutilation of their feet, is often cited as
                    evidence of the brutal, violent turn taken by German fairy tales. Yet the Grimms' punishment for the
                    stepsisters is relatively mild when compared to what befalls their counterparts in other cultures.
                    An Indonesian Cinderella forces her stepsister into a cauldron of boiling water, then has the body
                    cut up, pickled, and sent to the girl's mother as "salt meat" for her next meal. A Filipino variant
                    shows the stepmother and her daughters "pulled to pieces by wild horses." And a Japanese stepsister
                    is dragged around in a basket, tumbles over the edge of a deep ditch, and falls to her death.1
                    Many versions of "Cinderella," however, end on a conciliatory note. Charles Perrault offers what is
                    perhaps the fullest elaboration of a reconciliation between the heroine and her stepsisters, who
                    throw themselves at Cinderella's feet and beg her forgiveness. This Cinderella, who is as good as
                    she is beautiful, not only pardons the sisters but also invites them to join her in the palace and
                    loses no time in marrying them to two high- ranking court officials. An Armenian Cinderella falls at
                    the feet of her wicked sisters as they are leaving church, weeps copious tears with them, and bears
                    them no grudge.2 And finally, a recent American version marketed through elementary schools stages a
                    crudely sentimental reconciliation scene, presumably designed to appeal to the educators and parents
                    buying the book:
                    [The sisters] begged Cinderella to forgive them for being so mean to her.
                    Cinderella told them they were forgiven.
                    “I am sure you will never be mean to me again,” she said.
                    "Oh, never," said the older sister.
                    "Never, ever," said the younger sister.
                    Cinderella has been reinvented by so many different cultures that it is hardly surprising to find
                    that she is sometimes cruel and vindictive, at other times compassionate and kind. Even within a
                    single cultural zone, she can appear genteel and self-effacing in one story, clever and enterprising
                    in another, coy and manipulative in a third. Still, Jane Yolen may have a point when she asserts
                    that the shrewd, resourceful heroine of folktales from earlier centuries has been supplanted by a
                    "passive princess" waiting for Prince Charming to rescue her. Disney's Cinderella, as we shall see,
                    is a shrinking
                    violet by comparison with some of her folkloric ancestors, who refuse to stay at home suffering in
                    silence and who become adept at engineering their own rescues. Just how spirited and resourceful was
                    Cinderella in her earliest incarnations? Answering that question requires surveying a vast array of
                    tales featuring heroines known not only as Cinderella, Cendrillon, Ash Girl, and Cennerentola, but
                    also as Rashin Coatie, Mossy Coat, Catskin, Katie Woodencloak, and Donkeyskin. The Aarne-
                    Thompson-Uther index of tale types identifies two distinct Cinderella tales: ATU 510A ("Cinderella")
                    and ATU 510B ("The Dress of Gold, of Silver, and of Stars," also known as "Cap o' Rushes," etc.).
                    The two narratives encoded in the tale-type indexes seem virtually unrelated at first glance. The
                    plots of “Cinderella" stories are driven by the anxious jealousy of biological mothers and
                    stepmothers who subject the heroine to one ordeal of domestic drudgery after another; the plots of
                    “Catskin” tales are fueled by the erotic passion of fathers, whose unseemly behavior drives their
                    daughters from home.
                    In tales depicting the social persecution of a girl by her stepmother, the central focus comes to
                    rest on the unbearable family situation produced by a father's remarriage. But while the father's
                    responsibility for creating turmoil by choosing an inappropriate marriage partner recedes into the
                    background or is suppressed over time (even as the father himself is virtually eliminated as a
                    character), the foul deeds of his wife come to occupy center stage. We see her throwing her
                    stepdaughter into a river, instructing a hunter to kill her and recover her lungs and liver for
                    dinner, sending her into a snowstorm wearing nothing but a shift, depriving her of food, and making
                    her life wretched in every way.
                    In tales depicting erotic persecution of a daughter by her father, stepmothers and their daughters
                    tend to vanish from the central arena of action. Yet the father's desire for his daughter in the
                    second tale type furnishes a powerful motive for a stepmother's jealous rages and unnatural deeds in
                    the first tale type. Psychoanalytic criticism has read “Cinderella” and “Catskin” as enactments of
                    Oedipal desires, with each tale suppressing one component (love for the father or hatred of the
                    mother) of the Oedipal plot. Many "Catskin" narratives, among them Perrault's “Donkeyskin” (see
                    here) and the Grimms' "Thousandfurs," mount two phases of action: in the first the heroine is
                    persecuted by her father, in the second she turns into a Cinderella figure, obliged to spend her
                    days in domestic servitude under the supervision of a despotic cook or a queen.
                    Yet there is an even more compelling case for arguing that the tales captured the hard facts of
                    everyday life, staging domestic arrangements that led to the physical and sexual abuse of girls,
                    with cruel parents and stepparents who exploit rather than protect the young. Our headlines today
                    reveal that the dark side of fairy tales like "Cinderella" and "Donkeyskin” still come true today.
                    They are a stark reminder that domestic violence does not belong exclusively to the "long ago and
                    far away.”
                    While wicked stepmothers figure prominently in fairy tales disseminated in our culture, fathers who
                    persecute their daughters by showing them too much affection are virtually unknown. “Cinderella,”
                    “Snow White,” and “Hansel and Gretel" are the tales from Perrault and from the Grimms that continue
                    to thrive even on foreign soil, while stories such as "Donkeyskin" and "Thousandfurs" have either
                    failed to take root or have been modified beyond recognition, with the result that fathers have a
                    surprisingly limited role in fairy tales transmitted today.
                    It is important to bear in mind that the passive or absent father was, even a century ago, not the
                    rule in fairy tales. As Marian Cox's nineteenth-century study of 345 variants of "Cinderella" makes
                    clear, at least two widespread and pervasive versions of the tale attributed the heroine's social
                    degradation either to what Cox describes in characteristic Victorian language as an “unnatural
                    father” or to a father who attempts to extract from his daughter a statement about her filial
                    devotion. Of the 226 tales belonging unambiguously to one of the three categories labeled by Cox as
                    (1) ill-treated heroine (with mothers, stepmothers, and their progeny as victimizers), (2) unnatural
                    father, and (3) King Lear judgment, 130 belong to the first class, 77 to the second, and 19 to the
                    third. Thus in the tales examined by Cox, the versions that cast (step)mothers in the role of
                    villain only slightly outnumber those that ascribe Cinderella's misfortune to an importunate father.
                    Cinderella and her cousins were, therefore, once almost as likely to flee the household because of
                    their father's perverse erotic attachment to them or because of his insistence on a verbal
                    declaration of love, as they were to be banished to the hearth and degraded to domestic servitude by
                    an ill-tempered stepmother.
                    That our own culture would suppress the theme of paternal erotic pursuit and indulge freely in
                    elaborate variations on the theme of maternal tyranny is perhaps not surprising on a number of
                    counts. Since tales such as Perrault's "Donkeyskin" and the Grimms'
                    "Thousandfurs" make for troubling reading matter for adults, it hardly seems advisable to put them
                    between the covers of books for children. But Marina Warner has argued that there is something more
                    at stake in this evolutionary turn in the Cinderella story:
                    When interest in psychological realism is at work in the mind of the receiver of traditional
                    folklore, the proposed marriage of a father to his daughter becomes too hard to accept. But it is
                    only too hard to accept precisely because it belongs to a different order of reality/fantasy from
                    the donkeyskin disguise or the gold excrement or the other magical motifs: because it is not
                    impossible, because it could actually happen, and is known to have done so. It is when fairy tales
                    coincide with experience that they begin to suffer from censoring, rather than the other way
                    around.
                    The censorship to which Warner refers seems to have led to dramatic editorial interventions very
                    early on, perhaps as the tale made its way from an oral culture to a literary tradition. In
                    Straparola's seventeenth-century "Catskin” tale, the king is described as a “wicked father” with
                    “evil designs," "execrable lust,” and a “wicked and treacherous passion." Yet it is his wife who
                    decrees that the object of his lust and passion be their daughter Doralice. On her deathbed, the
                    queen beseeches her husband Tebaldo never to take anyone as wife whose finger does not perfectly fit
                    her own wedding ring. Faithful husband that he is, Tebaldo makes it a condition "that any damsel who
                    might be offered to him in marriage should first try on her finger his wife's ring, to see whether
                    it fitted." When the king fails to find a woman whose finger fits the ring, he turns to his daughter
                    and discovers that the fit is perfect. As Tebaldo tells his daughter, he is obliged to marry her for
                    it is the only way “I shall satisfy my own desire without violating the promise I made to your
                    mother.”
                    While some readers will not be persuaded by Tebaldo's logic and by the narrator's efforts to
                    exonerate the king, many others have clearly bought right into the rhetoric of self-justification
                    set forth in other Catskin tales. Consider one critic's gloss on the family dynamics in Perrault's
                    “Donkeyskin”: “The dying queen had a vengeful streak: she made her husband... swear not to remarry
                    unless he found a woman superior to her in beauty and goodness. Entrapped, the king eventually
                    discovers that only his lovely daughter can fill the bill." Another critic finds that “Rashie-Coat's
                    degradation is consequent upon her dying mother's unfortunate imprudence."2 Again and again, mothers
                    are the real villains,
                    extracting promises that end by victimizing both father and daughter. Everywhere we look, the
                    tendency to defame women and to magnify maternal evil emerges. Even when a tale turns on a father's
                    incestuous desires, the mother becomes more than complicit: she has stirred up the trouble in the
                    first place by setting the conditions for her husband's remarriage.
                    The ring episode in Straparola's "Catskin” does suggest one hitherto neglected point of contact
                    between "Cinderella” tales and "Catskin" stories. Finding the perfect fit between fingers and rings
                    and between feet and shoes becomes a task set to both fathers and princes, who now and then
                    collaborate with each other (as in the Grimms' "Cinderella"), who sometimes work in succession (as
                    in Perrault's "Donkeyskin"), and who are occasionally concurrent rivals, as in an Indian tale titled
                    "The Father Who Wanted to Marry His Daughter."10 What these stories demonstrate, perhaps more
                    forcefully than anything else, is the way in which the path to happy heterosexual unions depends on
                    a successful transfer of filial love and devotion from a father to a "prince," on a move from a
                    false "perfect fit" to a true "perfect fit.”
                    While Catskin tales raise the charged issue of incestuous desire and place the heroine in jeopardy,
                    they also furnish a rare stage for creative action. Unlike Cinderella, who endures humiliation at
                    home and becomes the beneficiary of lavish gifts, the heroine of Catskin tales is mobile, active,
                    and resourceful. She begins with a strong assertion of will, resistant to the paternal desires that
                    would claim her. Fleeing the household, she moves out into an alien world that requires her to be
                    inventive, energetic, and enterprising if she is to reestablish herself, to reclaim her royal rank,
                    and to marry the prince. To be sure, her resourcefulness is confined largely to sartorial and
                    culinary arts, but these were, after all, the two areas in which women traditionally could
                    distinguish themselves. The Grimms' Thousandfurs dazzles with her dress, and she successfully uses
                    her cuisine to lure the prince. Donkeyskin's powers of attraction are also explicitly linked to her
                    wardrobe and her baking skills.
                    That these stories are disappearing from the folkloric arena is perhaps not surprising. The theme of
                    incest alone would account for the steady erosion of interest in anthologizing the tale. But in
                    addition, the story's critique of paternal authority and its endorsement of filial disobedience turn
                    it into an unlikely candidate for bedtime reading. What are we to make of a story that positions a
                    father as the agent of transgressive sexuality and the daughter as the enforcer of cultural law and
                    order? Perrault, who felt that fairy tales ought to transmit lessons to children about virtue and
                    vice, was so mystified by “Donkeyskin” that he appended a comment that is absurdly irrelevant to the
                    terms of the text: "The story of Donkeyskin may be hard to believe, but as long as there are
                    children, mothers, and grandmothers in this world, it will be fondly remembered by all" (see here).
                    What is far harder to believe than the story itself is the idea that this particular tale could
                    generate “fond" memories.
                    In staging the attempted violation of a sacred taboo, Catskin stories celebrate daughters as agents
                    of resistance, yet also enshrine them as maintaining the sanctity of cultural codes. Giambattista
                    Basile captured exactly what made this story unacceptable to later generations when he spelled out
                    its moral:
                    The wise man spoke well when he said that one cannot obey commands of gall with obedience sweet as
                    sugar. Man must give only well-measured commands if he expects well-weighed obedience, and
                    resistance springs from wrongful orders, as happened in the case of the King of Roccaspra, who, by
                    asking for what was unseemly from his daughter, caused her to run away at the peril of her life and
                    honor.
                    While there are virtually no male counterparts to Catskin (mother/son incest seems to resist
                    representation in folktales), male Cinderellas abound in the folklore of many cultures. Aarne and
                    Thompson felt obliged to accommodate these male Cinderellas in their index of tale types by setting
                    up a separate category of Cinderella tales identified by the rubric AT 511 (“One-Eye, Two-Eyes, and
                    Three-Eyes" for female Cinderellas) and AT 511A (“The Little Red Ox” for male Cinderellas). The
                    distinction is little more than theoretical, for in practice, tales such as "The Little Red Ox” (a
                    story in which the protagonist's mother returns in the form of a donor-ox) seem to feature girls
                    almost as often as boys. These tales neutralize the persecutions of a wicked stepmother with the
                    sustenance, nurturing, and rescue provided by an animal that is clearly identified with the dead
                    mother. The Indian “Story of the Black Cow" (see here) belongs to a tale type that has virtually
                    disappeared from our folkloristic repertoire but once enjoyed the kind of popularity that
                    “Cinderella” has attained today. That male Cinderellas have vanished from our own cultural horizon
                    challenges us to understand exactly what it was that once allowed both girls and boys to participate
                    in the developmental trajectory outlined in the tale.
