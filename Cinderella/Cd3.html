                    It was not once upon a time, but at a certain time in history, before anyone knew what was
                    happening, that Walt Disney cast a spell on the fairy tale, and he has held it captive ever since.
                    He did not use a magic wand or demonic powers. On the contrary, Disney employed the most up-to-date
                    technological means and used his own "American" grit and ingenuity to appropriate European fairy
                    tales. His technical skills and ideological proclivities were so consummate that his signature has
                    [obscured] the names of Charles Perrault, the Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, and Carlo
                    Collodi. If children or Cinderella, they will think Walt Disney. Their first and perhaps lasting
                    impressions of these tales and others will have emanated from a Disney film, book, or artifact.
                    Though other filmmakers and animators produced remarkable fairy-tale films, Disney managed to gain a
                    cultural stranglehold on the fairy tale, and this stranglehold has even tightened with the recent
                    productions of Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992). The man's spell over the fairy tale
                    seems to live on even after his death.
                    But what does the Disney spell mean? Did Disney achieve a complete monopoly on the fairy tale during
                    his lifetime? Did he imprint a particular American vision on the fairy tale through his animated
                    films that dominates our perspective today? And, if he did manage to cast his mass-mediated spell on
                    the fairy tale so that we see and read the classical tales through his lens, is that so terrible?
                    Was Disney a nefarious wizard of some kind whose domination of the fairy tale should be lamented?
                    Wasn't he just more inventive, more skillful, more in touch with the American spirit of the times
                    than his competitors, who also sought to animate the classical fairy tale for the screen?
                    Of course, it would be a great exaggeration to maintain that Disney's spell totally divested the
                    classical fairy tales of their meaning and invested them with his own. But it would not be an
                    exaggeration to assert that Disney was a radical filmmaker who changed our way of viewing fairy
                    tales, and that his revolutionary technical means capitalized on American innocence and utopianism
                    to reinforce the social and political status quo. His radicalism was of the right and the righteous.
                    The great “magic” of the Disney spell is that he animated the fairy tale only to transfix audiences
                    and divert their potential utopian dreams and hopes through the false promises of the images he cast
                    upon the screen. But before we come to a full understanding of this magical spell, we must try to
                    understand what he did to the fairy tale that was so revolutionary and why he did it.
                    The Oral and Literary Fairy Tales
                    The evolution of the fairy tale as a literary genre is marked by dialectical appropriation that set
                    the cultural conditions for its institutionalization and its expansion as a mass- mediated form
                    through radio, film, and television. Fairy tales were first told by gifted tellers and were based on
                    rituals intended to endow with meaning the daily lives of members of a tribe. As oral folk tales,
                    they were intended to explain natural occurrences such as the change of the seasons and shifts in
                    the weather or to celebrate the rites of harvesting, hunting, marriage, and conquest. The emphasis
                    in most folk tales was on communal harmony. A narrator or narrators told tales to bring members of a
                    group or tribe closer together and to provide them with a sense of mission, a telos. The
                    talesthemselves assumed a generic quality based on the function that they were to fulfill for the
                    community or the incidents that they were to report, describe, and explain. Consequently, there were
                    tales of initiation, worship, warning, and indoctrination. Whatever the type may have been, the
                    voice of the narrator was known. The tales came directly from common experiences and beliefs. Told
                    in person, directly, face-to-face, they were altered as the beliefs and behaviors of the members of
                    a particular group changed. With the rise of literacy and the invention of the printing press in the
                    fifteenth century, the oral tradition of storytelling underwent an immense revolution. The oral
                    tales were taken over by a different social class, and the form, themes, production, and reception
                    of the tales were transformed. This change did not happen overnight, but it did foster
                    discrimination among writers and their audiences almost immediately so that distinct genres were
                    recognized and approved for certain occasions and functions within polite society or cultivated
                    circles of readers. In the case of folk tales, they were gradually categorized as legends, myths,
                    fables, comical anecdotes, and, of course, fairy tales. What we today consider fairy tales were
                    actually just one type of the folk-tale tradition, namely the Zaubermärchen or the magic tale, which
                    has many sub-genres. The French writers of the late seventeenth century called these tales contes de
                    fées (fairy tales) to distinguish them from other kinds of contes populaires (popular tales), and
                    what really distinguished a conte de fée, based on the oral Zaubermärchen, was its transformation
                    into a literary tale that addressed the concerns, tastes, and functions of court society. The fairy
                    tale had to fit into the French salons, parlors, and courts of the aristocracy and bourgeoisie if it
                    was to establish itself as a genre. The writers, Mme D'Aulnoy, Charles Perrault, Mlle L'Héritier,
                    Mlle de La Force, etc., knew and expanded upon oral and literary tales. They were not the initiators
                    of the literary fairytale tradition in Europe (cf. Zipes 1989). Two Italian writers, Giovanni
                    Francesco Straparola and Giambattista Basile, had already set an example for what the French were
                    accomplishing.1 But the French writers created an institution, that is, the genre of the literary
                    fairy tale was institutionalized as an aesthetic and social means through which questions and issues
                    of civilité, proper behavior and demeanor in all types of situations, were mapped out as narrative
                    strategies for literary socialization, and in many cases, as symbolic gestures of subversion to
                    question the ruling standards of taste and behavior.
                    While the literary fairy tale was being institutionalized at the end of the seventeenth and
                    beginning of the eighteenth century in France, the oral tradition did not disappear, nor was it
                    subsumed by the new literary genre. Rather, the oral tradition continued to feed the writers with
                    material and was now also influenced by the literary tradition
                    itself. The early chapbooks (cheap books), known as the Bibliothèque Bleue, that were carried by
                    peddlers or colporteurs to the villages throughout France contained numerous abbreviated and
                    truncated versions of the literary tales, and these were in turn told once again in these
                    communities. In some cases, the literary tales presented new material that was transformed through
                    the oral tradition and returned later to literature by a writer who remembered hearing a particular
                    story.
                    By the beginning of the nineteenth century when the Brothers Grimm set about to celebrate German
                    culture through their country's folk tales, the literary fairy tale had long since been
                    institutionalized, and they, along with Hans Christian Andersen, Carlo Collodi, Ludwig Bechstein,
                    and a host of Victorian writers from George MacDonald to Oscar Wilde, assumed different ideological
                    and aesthetic positions within this institutionalization. These writers put the finishing touches on
                    the fairy-tale genre at a time when nation-states were assuming their modern form and cultivating
                    particular types of literature as commensurate expressions of national cultures.
                    What were the major prescriptions, expectations, and standards of the literary fairy tale by the end
                    of the nineteenth century? Here it is important first to make some general remarks about the
                    “violent” shift from the oral to the literary tradition and not just talk about the appropriation of
                    the magic folk tale as a dialectical process. Appropriation does not occur without violence to the
                    rhetorical text created in the oral tales. Such violation of oral storytelling was crucial and
                    necessary for the establishment of the bourgeoisie because it concerned the control of desire and
                    imagination within the symbolic order of western culture.
                    * * *
                    Unlike the oral tradition, the literary tale was written down to be read in private, although, in
                    some cases, the fairy tales were read aloud in parlors. However, the book form enabled the reader to
                    withdraw from his or her society and to be alone with a tale. This privatization violated the
                    communal aspects of the folk tale, but the very printing of a fairy tale was already a violation
                    since it was based on separation of social classes. Extremely few people could read, and the fairy
                    tale in form and content furthered notions of elitism and separation. In fact, the French fairy
                    tales heightened the aspect of the chosen aristocratic elite who were always placed at the center of
                    the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century narratives. They were part and parcel of the class struggles
                    in the discourses of that period. To a certain extent, the fairy tales were the outcome of violent
                    “civilized" struggles, material representations, which represented struggles for hegemony. As Nancy
                    Armstrong and Leonard Tennenhouse have suggested, a class of people cannot produce themselves as a
                    ruling class without setting themselves off against certain Others. Their hegemony entails
                    possession of the key cultural terms determining what are the right and wrong ways to be a human
                    being. </p>
