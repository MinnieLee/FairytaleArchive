                    If we were able to take as the finest allegory of simulation the Borges tale where the cartographers
                    of the Empire draw up a map so detailed that it ends up exactly covering the territory (but where,
                    with the decline of the Empire this map becomes frayed and finally ruined, a few shreds still
                    discernible in the deserts - the metaphysical beauty of this ruined abstraction, bearing witness to
                    an imperial pride and rotting like a carcass, returning to the substance of the soil, rather as an
                    aging double ends up being confused with the real thing), this fable would then have come full
                    circle for us, and now has nothing but the discrete charm of second-order simulacra.l Abstraction
                    today is no longer that of the map, the double, the mirror or the concept. Simulation is no longer
                    that of a territory, a referential being or a substance. It is the generation by models of a real
                    without origin or reality: a hyperreal. The territory no longer precedes the map, nor survives it.
                    Henceforth, it is the map that precedes the territory - precession of simulacra - it is the map that
                    engenders the territory and if we were to revive the fable today, it would be the territory whose
                    shreds are slowly rotting across the map. It is the real, and not the map, whose vestiges subsist
                    here and there, in the deserts which are no longer those of the Empire, but our own. The desert of
                    the real itself. In fact, even inverted, the fable is useless. Perhaps only the allegory of the
                    Empire remains. For it is with the same imperialism that present-day simulators try to make the
                    real, all the real, coincide with their simulation models. But it is no longer a question of either
                    maps or territory. Something has disappeared: the sovereign difference between them that was the
                    abstraction's charm. For it is the difference which forms the poetry of the map and the charm of the
                    territory, the magic of the concept and the charm of the real. This representational imaginary,
                    which both culminates in and is engulfed by the cartographer's mad project of an ideal coextensivity
                    between the map and the territory, disappears with simulation, whose operation is nuclear and
                    genetic, and no longer specular and discursive. With it goes all of metaphysics. No more mirror of
                    being and appearances, of the real and its concept; no more imaginary coextensivity: rather, genetic
                    miniaturization is the dimension of simulation. The real is produced from miniaturized units, from
                    matrices, memory banks and command models - and with these it can be reproduced an indefinite number
                    of times. It no longer has to be rational, since it is no longer measured against some ideal or
                    negative instance. It is nothing more thanoperational. In fact, since it is no longer enveloped by
                    an imaginary, it is no longer real at all. It is a hyperreal: the product of an irradiating
                    synthesis of combinatory models in a hyperspace without atmosphere. In this passage to a space whose
                    curvature is no longer that of the real, nor of truth, the age of simulation thus begins with a
                    liquidation of all referentials - worse: by their art)ficial resurrection in systems of signs, which
                    are a more ductile material than meaning, in that they lend themselves to all systems of
                    equivalence, all binary oppositions and all combinatory algebra. It is no longer a question of
                    imitation, nor of reduplication, nor even of parody. It is rather a question of substituting signs
                    of the real for the real itself; that is, an operation to deter every real process by its
                    operational double, a metastable, programmatic, perfect descriptive machine which provides all the
                    signs of the real and short-circuits all its vicissitudes. Never again will the real have to be
                    produced: this is the vital function of the model in a system of death, or rather of anticipated
                    resurrection which no longer leaves any chance even in the event of death. A hyperreal henceforth
                    sheltered from the imaginary, and from any distinction between the real and the imaginary, leaving
                    room only for the orbital recurrence of models and the simulated generation of difference.
